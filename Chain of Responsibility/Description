Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility (CoR) Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to pass through a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request, thus promoting loose coupling and flexibility in assigning responsibilities.

Key Components:
- Handler: Declares an interface for handling requests and for setting the next handler.
- ConcreteHandler: Implements the handler interface and processes the request or forwards it.
- Client: Initiates the request and builds the chain of handlers.

Real-World Analogy:
Think of a customer service system where a request is first handled by a chatbot. If it canâ€™t resolve the issue, it passes the request to a human agent, and if needed, the request is escalated to a manager. Each handler has the opportunity to process the request.

Usage Scenarios:
- When more than one object can handle a request and the handler is not known a priori.
- When you want to issue a request to one of several handlers without coupling the sender to the receiver.
- When the request handling logic should be dynamically changeable at runtime.

Benefits:
- Reduces coupling between sender and receiver.
- Adds flexibility in assigning responsibility to objects.
- Allows dynamic modification of the handler chain at runtime.

Limitations:
- May result in requests going unhandled if no handler in the chain can process it.
- Can be harder to debug due to the dynamic nature of handler chains.
