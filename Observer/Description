Observer Design Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

This pattern is widely used to implement distributed event-handling systems, ensuring that components remain loosely coupled and can react to changes in other parts of the system without tight integration.

Key Components:
- Subject: Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to attach, detach, and notify them.
- Observer: Defines an interface for receiving updates from the subject.
- ConcreteSubject: Stores state of interest to ConcreteObservers and sends notifications when state changes.
- ConcreteObserver: Implements the Observer interface to receive updates from the subject.

Real-World Analogy:
Think of a newspaper subscription. The newspaper publisher (subject) notifies all subscribers (observers) whenever a new edition is available. The subscribers don’t need to ask repeatedly; they simply react when notified.

Usage Scenarios:
- When changes to one object require updates to others, and you want to minimize coupling.
- In event-driven systems like GUI frameworks, where multiple objects may need to react to user actions.
- For implementing publish/subscribe mechanisms.

Benefits:
- Promotes loose coupling between subject and observers.
- Supports dynamic relationships – observers can be added or removed at runtime.
- Makes event-handling systems more flexible and scalable.

Limitations:
- May lead to unexpected updates if not carefully managed.
- Can be difficult to debug, especially with a large number of observers or complex chains of updates.
