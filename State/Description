State Design Pattern

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class, as different states encapsulate different behavior.

This pattern helps manage state-specific behavior in a clean, organized, and scalable way by delegating responsibilities to state objects instead of using complex conditional statements.

Key Components:
- Context: Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass and allows its behavior to change as the state changes.
- State (Interface or Abstract Class): Declares the interface for encapsulating behavior associated with a particular state.
- ConcreteState: Implements the behavior associated with a specific state of the context.

Real-World Analogy:
Think of a traffic light system. The traffic light (context) can be in different states like Green, Yellow, or Red. Each state determines how it behaves (e.g., how long it stays on or what it does next). As the state changes, so does the behavior.

Usage Scenarios:
- When an objectâ€™s behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
- To avoid long conditional or switch-case statements related to state transitions.
- In workflow engines, game development (e.g., character states), UI components, and protocol handlers.

Benefits:
- Organizes code related to specific states into separate classes.
- Makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- Promotes the open/closed principle by allowing new states to be added without modifying existing ones.

Limitations:
- Increases the number of classes in the system.
- Can introduce complexity if states share similar behavior or require coordination.
