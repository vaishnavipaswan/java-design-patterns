Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

It promotes the use of composition over inheritance by allowing different strategies (algorithms) to be selected and applied at runtime without altering the clientâ€™s code.

Key Components:
- Strategy: An interface common to all supported algorithms.
- ConcreteStrategy: Implements a specific algorithm or behavior.
- Context: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and allows switching strategies dynamically.

Real-World Analogy:
Consider a navigation app that can provide routes based on different strategies: fastest route, shortest distance, or avoiding toll roads. Each of these routing methods is a strategy that can be selected based on user preference.

Usage Scenarios:
- When multiple related algorithms exist for a specific task and you want to make them easily interchangeable.
- To eliminate conditional statements (like if-else or switch-case) used for selecting behaviors.
- When different behaviors can be selected at runtime.

Benefits:
- Cleaner code structure by separating algorithm logic from business logic.
- Easy to add new strategies without changing the existing code.
- Promotes the Open/Closed Principle and code reuse.

Limitations:
- The client must be aware of different strategies and their differences.
- Can increase the number of classes in the system.

Variants:
- Strategies can be selected statically (at design time) or dynamically (at runtime).
- Strategies can be implemented as lambda expressions or function pointers in modern languages.
