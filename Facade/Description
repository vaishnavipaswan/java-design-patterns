Facade Design Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding its internal complexities.

This pattern is particularly helpful when working with large libraries or legacy systems, where the client does not need to know the details of the underlying components. Instead, the facade acts as an entry point that handles interactions with the subsystem on the client's behalf.

Key Components:
- Facade: The main class that provides a simple interface and delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem classes.
- Subsystems: The individual components that implement the actual functionality and are coordinated by the facade.

Real-World Analogy:
Think of a hotel concierge as a facade. Instead of interacting with the laundry service, room service, or tour desk individually, a guest can simply ask the concierge to take care of everything behind the scenes.

Usage Scenarios:
- When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex system.
- When you want to decouple a client from the internals of a subsystem.
- When working with legacy code thatâ€™s difficult to understand or refactor.

Benefits:
- Simplifies the client interface and usage.
- Promotes loose coupling between client and subsystem.
- Improves code readability and maintainability by hiding complexity.

Limitations:
- Can become a "god object" if it grows too complex.
- May limit flexibility if the client needs access to specific subsystem features not exposed by the facade.
